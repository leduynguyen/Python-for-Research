    "# Exercise 3\n",
    "A list of numbers can be very unsmooth, meaning very high numbers can be right next to very low numbers. This list may represent a smooth path in reality that is masked with random noise (for example, satellite trajectories with inaccurate transmission). One way to smooth the values in the list is to replace each value with the average of each value's neighbors, including the value itself.\n",

    "## Exercise 3a\n",
    "* Let's make a function moving_window_average(x, n_neighbors) that takes a list x and the number of neighbors n_neighbors on either side to consider. For each value, the function computes the average of each value's neighbors, including themselves. Have the function return a list of these averaged values that is the same length as the original list. If there are not enough neighbors (for cases near the edge), substitute the original value as many times as there are missing neighbors.\n",
