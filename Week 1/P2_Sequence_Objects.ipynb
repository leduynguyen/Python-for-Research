    "## Part 2: Sequence Objects\n",
    "### 2.1 Sequences\n",
    "In Python, there are three basic sequences, which are ***lists, tuples,*** and so-called ***\"range objects\"***.\n",
    "\n",
    "The first fundamental aspect to understand about sequences is that indexing starts at 0.\n",
    "\n",
    "So we can access sequences either by giving a **positive index**, which is counting a location from **left to right**, or we can use a **negative index**, which is counting positions from **right to left**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Sequences also support an operation called **\"slicing.\"** This first index, the first position is the start position, and the second position here is to stop position. ***Python slices stop before Python reaches the element at the stop location.***\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2.2 Lists\n",
    "Lists are one type of sequence and they are **mutable sequences of objects of any type**.\n",
    "\n",
    "In Python, I can use the plus sign as long as both objects are lists to concatenate them.\n",
    "\n",
    "Why do list methods such as **reverse and sort** return nothing? They are in-place methods, meaning they alter the content of the original list.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2.3 Tuples\n",
    "Tuples are **immutable sequences** typically used to store heterogeneous data. Because tuples are immutable, so they can't be edited after theyâ€™ve been created. The best way to view tuples is as a **single object that consists of several different parts**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Tuples have many uses in Python programming. One especially important use case is when you want to return more than one object from your Python function. In that case, you would typically wrap all of those objects within a single tuple object, and then return that tuple.\n",
    "\n",
    "Pack and unpack tuples. Construct a tuple object with two variables x and y in a coordinate tuples type. Then unpack the coordinate typle to 2 variables c1 and c2."

    "### 2.6 Sets\n",
    "Sets are unordered collections of distinct hashable objects. In practice, what that means is you **can use sets for immutable objects** like numbers and strings, but **not for mutable objects** like lists and dictionaries.\n",
    "There are two types of sets. \n",

    "    * And the other type of set is called \"a frozen set\".\n",

    "A set as an **unordered collection of objects**. One of the key ideas about sets is that they cannot be indexed. So the objects inside **sets don't have locations**.\n",
    "\n",

    "are always going to be unique or distinct.\n",
